                  <p class="u-text u-text-1"> In an industry that thrives on producing cheap thrills, Inception is a film that strives for more. This much is evident in the mesmerizing effect that it has on its audience. I can testify that it leaves me with an indescribable mixture of awe, confusion, and delight. The film builds in power and complexity until the final scene- a moment of great triumph mixed with a feeling of dread. We rejoice to see Cobb finally reunited with his kids, but fear the possibility that his top never falls. </p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Although cinephiles can spill ink on theories regarding Cobb’s final destination, it is obvious that Nolan never intended for us to know whether the top topples. I would argue that there is intentionality to this decision, so much so that the top’s scene serves as the primary message of the film. The movie had to happen <i>so that</i> we could see a wobbly top and a black screen. The ambiguity of the top is the movie’s true climax, not Cobb’s homecoming. This is what leaves us with an emotional dissonance.
                  </p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-3"> But viewers don’t rewatch Inception just to re-experience this confusion. It is the triumph and katharsis of Cobb sweeping up his son and daughter in a loving embrace that wells up tears in our eyes. So why does Inception include the ambiguity of the top, and why does the movie not finish with Cobb’s beautiful return? The answer is that both scenes display the Gospel and are necessary to the movie’s message. <b>Inception's storytelling captivates our hearts and minds because it is fundamentally an allegory of the Gospel.</b>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-1"> The first we see of Cobb is his skills of deception. As a so-called “extractor,” Cobb’s job is to lure out secrets from his victims. With the help of his team, he uses dream technology to fabricate a fake reality around his targets, then, while they are vulnerable to manipulation, pries out their secrets. In one of the first scenes of the movie, Cobb is targeting the mind of a man named Saito. He proceeds as usual, masquerading as a dream “consultant” willing to help Saito protect his mind from intrusion. However, Cobb is the real intruder. Cobb has planned for almost every contingency, but the mission quickly falls apart as Saito sees through the dream. Before Saito fully wakes, Cobb and his team flee the scene.</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-2"> So when Cobb is offered an opportunity to be exonerated of Mal’s death, he jumps at it. He assembles a team and brainstorms a plan. Soon, he is back on mission, immersed once again in the realm of dream.</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-3"> Dreams are where the conflict of Inception plays out. It is where characters are developed, fights are had, and secrets are exposed. Yet this setting is not a particular place, but a collection of memories. When characters live in dreams, they live in a shared space; people or objects encountered by a character could have originated from their mind or another’s, but regardless of their origin, they are tangible objects in the dreamers’ collective reality. Entities in dreams also must have some connection to Reality (the true reality) for them to exist, because at the end of the day, a dream is just living memories. Nothing can be truly created in a dream, only replicated or recontextualized. Dreams are also unstable. Although characters have the ability to build whatever (or whomever) they want in the dream world, sometimes things slip through the cracks. The movie time and time again warns us of the “subconscious,” a vaguely-defined part of oneself that has a mind of its own. The subconscious is capable of bringing memories into the dream, and it is what is primarily responsible for the animation of the dream world. The dreamer’s subconscious naturally fills in the gaps in the dream world in step with the dreamer’s memory.</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-4"> It is this setting where Cobb often finds himself alone with his late wife, Mal. We discover that Cobb uses dreams not just as a way to extract information from others, but to revisit his own memories. In one brief scene, Ariadne, the team’s architect, stumbles across Cobb passed out on a reclining chair next to Yus​uf, the team’s sedation specialist. Cobb assures her that he is simply “running tests” late at night, but Ariadne knows that Cobb is hiding a dark past. Ariadne encountered Mal, projected by Cobb’s subconscious, in one of her own dreams. This projection of Mal made no hesitation to kill Ariadne, violently waking her. Although Cobb assured Ariadne that Mal was simply another projection of his mind, it was obvious to Ariadne that Mal was not just another faceless projection, but an insidious queen of darkness ruling Cobb’s subconscious. We learn that the more Cobb indulges in the self-medication of dream, the more Mal grows in power. She thrives in the darkness because Cobb is not held accountable to part with her. It is only later in the movie that we see how far Cobb has fallen and how difficult it has become for him to give her up. She represents the primary idol of Cobb’s heart.</p>
                  <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-2" src="images/projections.png" alt="" data-image-width="1600" data-image-height="667">
                  <p class="u-text u-text-5"> It is said in Proverbs 4:23 to “keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.” Solomon is warning against what has happened to Cobb. Our hearts (much like the subconscious in Inception) are the source of everything we say, do, and think. It is the well-spring that powers us. A clean heart brings clean words to the lips and clean thoughts to the mind. A compromised heart can only produce unclean words and unclean thoughts. In the same way, the more Cobb entertains his desire to be with Mal, the more his subconscious brings her into others’ dreams. Ariadne notices this as soon as the plan to incept Fischer turns awry,</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-6"><i> Ariadne: Cobb, you might have convinced the rest of this team to carry on with the job. But they don't know the truth.&nbsp;<br>Cobb: What truth?&nbsp;<br>Ariadne: The truth that at any minute you might bring a freight train&nbsp; through the wall. The truth that Mal is bursting up through your&nbsp; subconscious!</i>
                  </p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-7"> Ariadne is begging Cobb to bring his sin into the light and to let the rest of the team know, but he is unwilling. He denies that his subconscious will cause any further harm to others, but he is wrong. Only until his final climactic encounter with Mal do we see the exposed root of his sin. Until then, he lets his sin fester. The more he returns to her, the more his heart gives up what is real and settles for what is only a dream. This is the primary conflict of the movie and a central point in Nolan’s narration of the Gospel: Cobb’s attachment to Mal, his pet sin.</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-8"> Cobb’s fantasizing is what the philosopher Plato predicted would be all of our fates, unless we are brought into the Light. As a philosopher, Plato desired to know Truth in its fullness. He hated the thought of living a lie and wanted others to join him in the search for Truth, wherever that would lead him. As Plato sought Truth, he became more conscious of what was holding him back. He looked around him and saw that his culture cared little for Truth. They were content with what they could see in front of them. They dismissed Plato’s philosophies as nothing more than the dreamy musings of a madman. In his frustration, Plato set out to show others the world they failed to see. To convey his thoughts on the destructiveness of keeping lesser realities alive, Plato described an allegory of a cave:</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-9"><i> “Picture men dwelling in a sort of subterranean cavern with a long entrance open to the light on its entire width. Conceive them as having their legs and necks fettered from childhood, so that they remain in the same spot, able to look forward only, and prevented by the fetters from turning their heads. Picture further the light from a fire burning higher up and at a distance behind them, and between the fire and the prisoners and above them a road along which a low wall has been built, as the exhibitors of puppet shows have partitions before the men themselves, above which they show the puppets. … See also, then, men carrying past the wall implements of all kinds that rise above the wall, and human images and shapes of animals as well, wrought in stone and wood and every material, some of these bearers presumably speaking and others silent. … For, to begin with, tell me do you think that these men would have seen anything of themselves or of one another except the shadows cast from the fire on the wall of the cave that fronted them? …Then in every way such prisoners would deem reality to be nothing else than the shadows of the artificial objects.”</i>
                  </p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-10"> Plato argued that men raised in the dim light of the cave would become accustomed to its scenery, the shadows projected onto the cave wall. These shadows were silhouettes of objects passing in front of a burning fire. Although these shadows were pitiful renderings of the vivid world above them, Plato argued that the prisoners would be content with their life because it was all they had ever known. How could the notion of sunlight exist in their mind if they had never experienced it? Plato continued,</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-11"><i> “When one was freed from his fetters and compelled to stand up suddenly and turn his head around and walk and to lift up his eyes to the light, and in doing all this felt pain and, because of the dazzle and glitter of the light, was unable to discern the objects whose shadows he formerly saw, what do you suppose would be his answer if someone told him that what he had seen before was all a cheat and an illusion, but that now, being nearer to reality and turned toward more real things, he saw more truly? And if also one should point out to him each of the passing objects and constrain him by questions to say what it is, do you not think that he would be at a loss and that he would regard what he formerly saw as more real than the things now pointed out to him?”</i>
                  </p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-12"> The prisoners would not only view unfiltered sunlight as a pain to their eyes, but also as a source of blindness. If their conception of Reality was limited to cave shadows, and if exposure to the sunlight diminished their ability to see shadows (a normal effect of eyes adjusted to light), they would almost certainly turn away from the light to once again embrace the darkness- their truth. What would be necessary to convince the prisoners that their world was a lie and that a true sunlight could be found that could illuminate real objects?</p>
                  <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-3" src="images/platos-cave-2.png" alt="" data-image-width="875" data-image-height="581">
                  <p class="u-text u-text-13"> Plato believed that no amount of persuasion could win over the hearts and minds of the prisoners to convince them to leave the cave. Who could persuade another to give up the world they had known from birth? Force was the only solution. The prisoners would need to be dragged out into the light and chained down, this time in full exposure to the sun. Their eyes would need to endure the painful adjustment to the sun’s rays. Only after much suffering would the prisoners see that the world they had once known was only a faint reflection of the world they could now see in vivid color. During the slow process of adjustment, their attention would be on the world they had left behind, but on the other side of their suffering, their attention would be fixed on the beauty of the world around them.</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-14"> Cobb, just like the prisoners of the cave, had no desire to seek Reality, only Mal. There was a time when he enjoyed the presence of his wife in the real world, but that time was always limited. Because his heart’s sole attachment was to Mal, a person who would inevitably fade away, he staked his heart on the world of shadow. Though he was living in the real world, he cared little for Reality. Just like how a struggling swimmer is still drowning before they sink beneath the water, Cobb’s heart was still sick <i>before</i> Mal died. Her death only expedited Cobb’s decline into desperation. It was not that Cobb had erred by loving Mal- he had erred by letting her become his Reality. Mal’s love for Cobb was always the fire of the cave, never the light of the sun. Even when Mal was still alive, Cobb had long given up what was real. The eyes of his heart had been firmly fixed on the cave wall.
                  </p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-15"> Just as Cobb had fully resigned to the world of shadow, Paul describes us before Christ as having been fully resigned to our sin. According to Ephesians 2:1-4, we were in rebellion to Reality Himself,</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-16"><i> “And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.”</i>
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-17"> It was not that we were slightly injured or even in need of dire amputation- we were dead. Our hearts had been fully overrun by evil, fully opposed to God’s love, and fully numb to our dreadful state of existence. We didn’t just need a pep talk or a moral leader to follow- we needed new life.</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-18"> This is the bitter reality that Cobb endures for almost the entirety of the film. Mal foils his attempts to carry on like nothing is wrong up until the last few scenes. In a moment of hesitation, Cobb fails to shoot Mal and lets Fischer die. The consequences of his pet sin come to bear on him as he and the rest of his team stand helpless around Fischer’s dead body. But despite this failure, Cobb is given another chance to give up Mal. He descends to Limbo, accompanied by Ariadne.</p>

        <img class="u-expanded-width u-image u-image-default u-image-1" src="images/limboshore.jpg" alt="" data-image-width="1920" data-image-height="1080">
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2"> As our two protagonists emerge from the waves, we finally see the world that Cobb has named “Limbo.” The shooting script for Inception (written by Nolan himself) describes the landscape,</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-3"><i> “Cobb and Ariadne climb out of the waves, full speed. They move into the shadow of the tall, crumbling buildings. The streets are eerily deserted. As they move further in, the buildings become newer, different. Ariadne marvels at the extraordinary collection of buildings− every architectural style imaginable in waves of failed utopias.”</i>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-4"> Limbo was exactly that- a world of failed utopias. It was the result of decades of architectural expansion as Cobb and Mal etched every one of their dreams into reality. Nothing was off limits to build, as long as it came from their memories. There was infinite time and infinite potential. Even the world itself seemed to have no borders to hold them back. Cobb had everything he ever wanted- companionship with his wife and a blank canvas in front of him … and yet he grew discontent. While at first he tried convincing his wife to leave Limbo, he eventually resorted to inception, tampering with her subconscious. His discontent grew so strong that he was willing to infect his wife with an idea (infection with a true idea- but infection nevertheless) in order to escape Limbo. But as he continued to idolize Mal in the real world, Limbo lived inside him. And when Mal died, the idol of his heart could only be placated by fantasy. He fixed his eyes on shadow, continuing to deny Reality.</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-5"> C.S. Lewis depicts a similar world to Limbo in his brief novel <i>The Great Divorce</i>. His world he calls “The Grey Town” and he uses it as a description of Hell itself. It is the initial setting of the book, the landing pad for the story’s nameless protagonist. The book picks up following the protagonist as he arrives without explanation in the Grey Town, much like how Cobb and Mal wash up onto the shores of Limbo. The protagonist peers around him and sees only dilapidated shops, deserted homes, and one peculiar bus stop. It is evening, but far enough into dusk that the sun has fallen below the horizon. The only gathering of people that he can see is idling in line at the bus stop, so our protagonist instinctively gets in line and waits. He notices that, one after one, the line shortens as people leave. Soon only a few remain in line. The patience of our protagonist is rewarded as the bus arrives, and he hops on. At once the magical vehicle soars into flight, flying high above the town. It is then that our protagonist turns to a fellow passenger and inquires about the emptiness of the place,
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-6"><i> "It seems the deuce of a town," I volunteered, "and that's what I can't understand. The parts of it that I saw were so empty. Was there once a much larger population?" "Not at all," said my neighbour. "The trouble is that they're so quarrelsome. As soon as anyone arrives he settles in some street. Before he's been there twenty-four hours he quarrels with his neighbour. Before the week is over he's quarrelled so badly that he decides to move. Very like he finds the next street empty because all the people there have quarrelled with their neighbours-and moved. So he settles in. If by any chance the street is full, he goes further. But even if he stays, it makes no odds. He's sure to have another quarrel pretty soon and then he'll move on again. Finally he'll move right out to the edge of the town and build a new house. You see, it's easy here. You've only got to think a house and there it is. That's how the town keeps on growing." "Leaving more and more empty streets?" "That's right. And time's sort of odd here. That place where we caught the bus is thousands of miles from the Civic Centre where all the newcomers arrive from earth. All the people you've met were living near the bus stop: but they'd taken centuries-of our time-to get there, by gradual removals." "And what about the earlier arrivals? I mean -there must be people who came from earth to your town even longer ago." "That's right. There are. They've been moving on and on. Getting further apart. They're so far off by now that they could never think of coming to the bus stop at all. Astronomical distances. There's a bit of rising ground near where I live and a chap has a telescope. You can see the lights of the inhabited houses, where those old ones live, millions of miles away. Millions of miles from us and from one another. Every now and then they move further still. That's one of the disappointments. I thought you'd meet interesting historical characters. But you don't: they're too far away."</i>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-7"> The Grey Town is infinite because its wanderers never settle down. They are perpetually discontent, driven mad by dissatisfaction, forced to double down on their misery. Their stubborn quarrelsomeness keeps them apart, always searching for a better place. There is nothing preventing them from returning to the bus stop (which we later find to be a step towards salvation), except for their insistence to make a utopia for themselves. In describing the town as such, Lewis posits his theology of Hell.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-8"> Hell, in Lewis’ eyes, is the infinite expansion of human desire. It is what happens when God lets us have our own way. It is us spinning our wheels, so to speak, for eternity. As humans, we were made for our Creator. We were made to drink from the well-spring of fellowship with God (Isaiah 55:1-3). He is the one who satisfies our restless desires and brings peace to the frenzy of our ever-shifting hearts. Without the security of his gentle love, we are nomads, tossed about by the waves (James 1:6). We embrace a state of Limbo.</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-9"> So as Cobb reflects on his time building Limbo, he becomes increasingly convicted of his need to sever his attachment to Mal. There is no joy in his heart or spring to his step as he passes by building after building, all in disarray. The vanity of his dreams unfolds before him, and he sees the shadows for what they are. His eyes are adjusting, straining in the sunlight. As he surveys the ruins of his former life, he commits to dethrone Mal, the idol of his heart.&nbsp;</p>
        <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-2" src="images/ariadneandcobbinlimbo.png" alt="" data-image-width="1242" data-image-height="516">
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-10"> Of course, he cannot do it alone. Just like how one must force the prisoners of the cave into the sunlight, so Ariadne is forcing Cobb to see Limbo for what it is. She is by his side, keeping him accountable. Her role in helping Cobb escape Limbo is mirrored by her mythological namesake. According to Greek mythology, the Cretan princess Ariadne was instrumental to Theseus’ defeat of the minotaur and eventual escape from the labyrinth. The story goes that the king of Crete, King Minos, constructed a maze so puzzling that no man could find its exit. At the center of this maze he placed a terrifying monster, a minotaur, half-man and half-bull. It was decreed that every 7 years 7 young men and 7 young women would be sacrificed to the minotaur by being thrown into the maze. One year, the hero Theseus was chosen to be one of the sacrifices. Lucky for him, the daughter of King Minos, Ariadne, fell in love with Theseus. Being unable to part with her lover, Ariadne gave Theseus a string that he could use to survive the maze. All he would need to do was unwind the string as he walked through the labyrinth. Once he was able to kill the Minotaur, Theseus could simply follow the string back to the entrance. Without her string, even if Theseus could kill the minotaur, he would have been left wandering the maze, eventually to die of starvation or even insanity. Likewise, without Ariadne, Cobb did not stand a chance to escape Limbo.</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-11"> As Cobb and Ariadne approach Mal’s lair, he braces himself for what is to come. Although his mind is committed to seek Reality, he still experiences the pain of separating from his old life. Once Cobb sets his eyes on Mal and Mal sees his new-found determination, she launches her appeals. She first attacks Cobb’s intellectual conviction, the belief that he is still sleeping. When she realizes the depth of his commitment to Reality, she instead shifts her appeals to target his base senses saying, “Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in one reality anymore. So choose. Choose your reality like I did. Choose to be here. Choose me.” Mal knows that Cobb intellectually believes that she is an illusion, so she appeals to his emotions. This is what C.S. Lewis describes in the book <i>Mere Christianity</i> as a “blitz on belief.” He explains,
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-12"><i> "​​I am not asking anyone to accept Christianity if his best reasoning tells him that the weight of evidence is against it. That is not the point at which faith comes in. But supposing a man’s reason once decides that the weight of the evidence is for it. I can tell that man what is going to happen to him in the next few weeks. There will come a moment when there is bad news, or he is in trouble, or is living among a lot of other people who do not believe it, and all at once his emotions will rise up and carry out a sort of blitz on his belief. Or else there will come a moment when he wants a woman, or wants to tell a lie, or feels very pleased with himself, or sees a chance of making a little money in some way that is not perfectly fair; some moment, in fact, at which it would be very convenient if Christianity were not true."</i>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-13"> Cobb is tempted with the tantalizing possibility of reuniting with Mal in Limbo. Although he has just walked past the ruins of their previous life together, his emotions tell him that- given one more chance- he could finally build the utopia of his dreams. As he hears his wife pleading with him, his emotions rise up in a blitz against his belief. And yet he stands firm. In a powerful moment of faith, he confesses his sin, bringing his failure of incepting Mal into the light and letting her go once for all. As she lurches at Cobb to kill him, Ariadne shoots her and she falls to the ground.</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-14"> With the dread of Mal out of mind, Cobb is changed. At this point he wants nothing more than to be with his children, but he first needs to rescue Saito. He remembers that by now Saito has died of his wound and has descended into his own Limbo. Having eyes now adjusted to the light, he seeks to go down into the cave that he came from in order to rescue his fellow dreamer. It is now Cobb’s responsibility to bring Saito into the light. Just as Ariadne accompanies Cobb on his quest to confront Mal, so does Cobb lead Saito out of his Limbo, representing an action of evangelism. Cobb’s heart to rescue the lost speaks of 1 John 1:3, “That which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.” Cobb has “seen and heard” of the joys of Reality, a place free of stale memories and frenzied discontent. A place where his children are waiting for him. And so, with the “radical notion” of Reality written on his heart, he desires to see Saito also experience the joy he now has. While the other members of his team ride the kick up to the first level of the dream and escape the submerged van, Cobb drowns and thus joins Saito’s Limbo.</p>

        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-15"> Awaking on Saito’s shore, Cobb is dazed and exhausted. The dilation of time has taken a toll on his mind, and he appears to have already lost his faith in Reality. To him, all that he had experienced had become a “half-remembered dream.” Saito’s projections find Cobb face-down on the shore and bring him before Saito for questioning. By now Saito has become an old man. Yet he still holds hope that Cobb will return for him. The guards empty Cobb’s pockets to find a gun and a top. As Cobb and Saito stare at each other from opposite ends of the table, they look to the top. Saito explains that he is waiting for someone, and doesn’t recognize Cobb at first. Cobb himself seems to have forgotten why he is there, but as his eyes drift towards the top, he notices that, as it spins, it never falls. His top reminds him why he has come for Saito; it grounds him in his faith. Cobb’s top represents the perseverance of the saints. Romans 11:29 declares, “The gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.” Despite Cobb’s forgetfulness, his top always stays with him. It is his assurance, his seal. It is what gives him the strength to deliver the good news to Saito, the news that there is a world out there beyond what either of them can imagine or create from memory. A world of newness.</p>
        <p class="u-align-left-md u-align-left-sm u-align-left-xl u-align-left-xs u-text u-text-16"> So as Cobb wakes to Reality, he wakes with a changed heart and full exoneration. He has finally come home. He grabs his kids with a tight embrace and savors the newness of Reality. His top spins on the table, but he doesn’t need it anymore. His faith has become sight.</p>
        <p class="u-align-left-md u-align-left-sm u-align-left-xl u-align-left-xs u-text u-text-17"> As the final chords of “Time​” fade into silence, we are left with a note of ambiguity. Is Cobb dreaming? The Gospel message at the heart of Inception makes it clear that the proper question should be directed towards ourselves. Are <i>you</i> still dreaming?
