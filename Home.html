        <p class="u-large-text u-text u-text-default u-text-variant u-text-2">There are few movies that captivate my attention long after the credits roll. Inception is one of these movies. It leaves me with an indescribable mixture of awe, confusion, and delight. The film builds in power and complexity until the final scene- a moment of great triumph mixed with a feeling of dread. We rejoice to see Cobb finally reconciled with his kids, but fear the possibility that his top never falls.

Although cinephiles can spill ink on theories about Cobb’s final destination, it is obvious that Nolan never intended us to know whether the top topples. I would argue that there is intentionality to this decision, so much so that the top’s scene serves as the primary message of the film. The movie had to happen so that we could see a wobbly top and a black screen. The ambiguity of the top is the movie’s true climax, not Cobb’s reconciliation to his kids. This is what leaves us with an emotional dissonance.

But viewers don’t rewatch Inception just to re-experience this confusion. It is the triumph and katharsis of Cobb sweeping up his son and daughter in a loving embrace that wells up tears in our eyes. So why does Inception include the ambiguity of the top, and why does the movie not finish with Cobb’s beautiful moment of reconciliation? The answer is that both scenes display the Gospel and are necessary to the movie’s message. The captivating humanity of Inception’s storytelling is rooted in its visual narration of the drama of salvation.

Introduction to Cobb

The first we see of Cobb is his skills of deception. As a so-called “extractor,” Cobb’s job is to lure out secrets from his victims. With the help of his team, he uses dream technology to fabricate a fake reality that captivates his targets to the point where they spill their secrets. In one of the first scenes of the movie, Cobb is targeting the mind of a man named Saito. He proceeds as usual, masquerading as a dream “consultant” willing to help Saito protect his mind from intrusion. However, Cobb is the real intruder. Cobb has planned for almost every contingency, but the mission quickly falls apart as Saito sees through the dream. Before Saito fully wakes, Cobb and his team flee the scene.

This is our introduction to Cobb as an extractor. We learn about his job and how he works. But it is only when we see him alone in his hotel room talking to his kids on the phone that we truly see the character of Cobb. As we hear him desperately console his kids and remind them to stay hopeful of his return, it is hard not to feel sympathy for him. At this point in the movie, he is doubtful whether he will ever see them again. Later in the movie we discover the reason for his exile, but this scene exists to show us one fact: Cobb will be restless until he returns home.

So when Cobb is offered an opportunity to be exonerated of Mal’s death, he jumps at it. He assembles a team and brainstorms a plan. Soon, he is back on mission, immersed once again in the realm of dream.

Dreams are where the conflict of Inception plays out. It is where characters are developed, fights are had, and secrets are exposed. Yet this setting is not a particular place, but a collection of memories. When characters live in dreams, they live in a shared space; people or objects encountered by a character could have originated from their mind or another’s, but regardless of their origin, they are tangible objects in the dreamers’ collective reality. Entities in dreams also must have some connection to Reality (the true reality); at the end of the day, a dream is just composed of memories. Nothing can be truly created in a dream, only replicated or recontextualized. Dreams are also unstable. Although characters have the ability to build whatever (or whomever) they want in the dream world, sometimes things slip through the cracks. The movie time and time again warns us of the “subconscious,” a vaguely-defined part of oneself that has a mind of its own. The subconscious is capable of bringing memories into the dream, and it is what is primarily responsible for the animation of the dream world. The dreamer’s subconscious naturally fills in the gaps in the dream world in step with the dreamer’s memory.

It is this setting where Cobb often finds himself alone with his late wife, Mal. We discover that Cobb uses dreams not just as a way to extract information from others, but to revisit his own memories. In one brief scene, Ariadne, the team’s architect, stumbles across Cobb passed out on a reclining chair next to Yusuf, the team’s sedation specialist. Cobb assures her that he is simply “running tests” late at night, but Ariadne knows that Cobb is hiding a dark past. Ariadne encountered Mal, projected by Cobb’s subconscious, in one of her own dreams. This projection of Mal made no hesitation to kill Ariadne, violently waking her. Although Cobb assured Ariadne that Mal was simply another projection of his mind, it was obvious to Ariadne that Mal was not just another faceless projection, but an insidious queen of darkness ruling Cobb’s subconscious. We learn that the more Cobb indulges in the self-medication of dream, the more Mal grows in power. She thrives in the darkness because Cobb is not held accountable to part with her. It is only later in the movie that we see how far Cobb has fallen and how difficult it has become for him to give her up. She represents the primary idol of Cobb’s heart.

It is said in Proverbs 4:23 to “keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.” Solomon is warning against what has happened to Cobb. Our hearts (much like the subconscious in Inception) are the source of everything we say, do, and think. It is the well-spring that powers us. A clean heart brings clean words to the lips and clean thoughts to the mind. A compromised heart can only produce unclean words and unclean thoughts. In the same way, the more Cobb entertains his desire to be with Mal, the more his subconscious brings her into others’ dreams. Ariadne notices this as soon as the plan to incept Fischer turns awry, 
“Ariadne: Cobb, you might have convinced the rest of this team to carry on with the job. But they don't know the truth. Cobb: What truth? Ariadne: The truth that at any minute you might bring a freight train through the wall. The truth that Mal is bursting up through your subconscious.” 
Ariadne is begging Cobb to bring his sin into the light and to let the rest of the team know, but he is unwilling. He denies that his subconscious will cause any further harm to others, but he is wrong. Only until his final climactic encounter with Mal do we see the exposed root of his sin. Until then, he lets his sin fester. The more he returns to her, the more his heart gives up what is real and settles for what is only a dream. This is the primary conflict of the movie and a central point in Nolan’s narration of the Gospel: Cobb’s attachment to Mal, his pet sin.

Cobb’s fantasizing is what the philosopher Plato predicted would be our fate, unless we are brought into the Light. As a philosopher, Plato desired to know Truth in its fullness. He hated the thought of living a lie and wanted others to join him in the search for Truth, wherever that would lead him. As Plato sought Truth, he became more conscious of what was holding him back. He looked around him and saw that his culture cared little for Truth. They were content with what they could see in front of them. They dismissed Plato’s philosophies as nothing more than the dreamy musings of a madman. In his frustration, Plato set out to show others the world they failed to see. To convey his thoughts on the destructiveness of keeping lesser realities alive, Plato described an allegory of a cave:

“Picture men dwelling in a sort of subterranean cavern with a long entrance open to the light on its entire width. Conceive them as having their legs and necks fettered from childhood, so that they remain in the same spot, able to look forward only, and prevented by the fetters from turning their heads. Picture further the light from a fire burning higher up and at a distance behind them, and between the fire and the prisoners and above them a road along which a low wall has been built, as the exhibitors of puppet shows have partitions before the men themselves, above which they show the puppets. … See also, then, men carrying past the wall implements of all kinds that rise above the wall, and human images and shapes of animals as well, wrought in stone and wood and every material, some of these bearers presumably speaking and others silent. … For, to begin with, tell me do you think that these men would have seen anything of themselves or of one another except the shadows cast from the fire on the wall of the cave that fronted them? …Then in every way such prisoners would deem reality to be nothing else than the shadows of the artificial objects.”
(https://yale.learningu.org/download/ca778ca3-7e93-4fa6-a03f-471e6f15028f/H2664_Allegory%20of%20the%20Cave%20.pdf)

Plato argued that men raised in the dim light of the cave would become accustomed to its scenery, the shadows projected onto the cave wall. These shadows were silhouettes of objects passing in front of a burning fire. Although these shadows were pitiful renderings of the vivid world above them, Plato argued that the prisoners would be content with their life because it was all they had ever known. How could the notion of sunlight exist in their mind if they had never experienced it? Plato continued,

“When one was freed from his fetters and compelled to stand up suddenly and turn his head around and walk and to lift up his eyes to the light, and in doing all this felt pain and, because of the dazzle and glitter of the light, was unable to discern the objects whose shadows he formerly saw, what do you suppose would be his answer if someone told him that what he had seen before was all a cheat and an illusion, but that now, being nearer to reality and turned toward more real things, he saw more truly? And if also one should point out to him each of the passing objects and constrain him by questions to say what it is, do you not think that he would be at a loss and that he would regard what he formerly saw as more real than the things now pointed out to him?”

The prisoners would not only view unfiltered sunlight as a pain to their eyes, but also as a source of blindness. If their conception of Reality was limited to cave shadows, and if exposure to the sunlight diminished their ability to see shadows (a normal effect of eyes adjusted to light), they would almost certainly turn away from the light to once again embrace the darkness- their truth. What would be necessary to convince the prisoners that their world was a lie and that a true sunlight could be found that could illuminate real objects?

Plato believed that no amount of persuasion could win over the hearts and minds of the prisoners to convince them to leave the cave. Who could persuade another to give up the world they had known from birth? Force was the only solution. The prisoners would need to be dragged out into the light and chained down, this time in full exposure to the sun. Their eyes would need to endure the painful adjustment to the sun’s rays. Only after much suffering would the prisoners see that the world they had once known was only a faint reflection of the world they could now see in vivid color. During the slow process of adjustment, their attention would be on the world they had left behind, but on the other side of their suffering, their attention would be fixed on the beauty of the world around them.

Cobb, just like the prisoners of the cave, had no desire to seek Reality, only Mal. There was a time when he enjoyed the presence of his wife in the real world, but that time was always limited. Because his heart’s sole attachment was to Mal, a person who would inevitably fade away, he staked his heart on the world of shadow. Though he was living in the real world, he cared little for Reality. Just like how a struggling swimmer is still drowning before they inhale their first gulp of water, Cobb’s heart was sick before Mal died. Her death only expedited Cobb’s decline into desperation. It was not that Cobb had erred by loving Mal- he had erred by letting her become his Reality. Mal’s love for Cobb was always the fire of the cave, never the light of the sun. Even when Mal was still alive, Cobb had long given up what was real. The eyes of his heart had been firmly fixed on the cave wall.

Just as Cobb had fully resigned to the world of shadow, Paul describes us before Christ as having been fully resigned to our sin. We were in rebellion to Reality himself,

“And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.” (Ephesians 2:1-4)

It was not that we were slightly injured or even in need of dire amputation- we were dead. Our hearts had been fully overrun by evil, fully opposed to God’s love, and fully numb to our dreadful state of existence. We didn’t just need a pep talk or a moral leader to follow- we needed new life.

This is the bitter reality that Cobb endures for almost the entirety of the film. Mal foils his attempts to carry on like nothing is wrong up until the last few scenes. In a moment of hesitation, Cobb fails to shoot Mal and lets Fischer die. The consequences of his pet sin come to bear on him as he and the rest of his team stand helpless around Fischer’s dead body. But despite this failure, Cobb is given another chance to give up Mal. But this time, Ariadne has a plan.

Limbo

As our two protagonists emerge from the waves, we finally see the world that Cobb has named “Limbo.” The shooting script for Inception (written by Nolan himself) describes the landscape,

“Cobb and Ariadne climb out of the waves, full speed. They move into the shadow of the tall, crumbling buildings. The streets are eerily deserted. As they move further in, the buildings become newer, different. Ariadne marvels at the extraordinary collection of buildings− every architectural style imaginable in waves of failed utopias.”

Limbo was exactly that- a world of failed utopias. It was the result of decades of architectural expansion as Cobb and Mal etched every one of their dreams into reality. Nothing was off limits to build, as long as it came from their memories. There was infinite time and infinite potential. Even the world itself seemed to have no borders to hold them back. Cobb had everything he ever wanted- companionship with his wife and a blank canvas in front of him … and yet he grew discontent. While at first he tried convincing his wife to leave Limbo, he eventually resorted to inception, tampering with her subconscious. His discontent grew so strong that he was willing to infect his wife with an idea (infection with a true idea- but infection nevertheless) in order to escape Limbo. But as he continued to idolize Mal in the real world, Limbo lived inside him. And when Mal died, the idol of his heart could only be placated by fantasy. He fixed his eyes on shadow, continuing to deny Reality.

C.S. Lewis depicts a similar world to Limbo in his brief novel The Great Divorce. His world he calls “The Grey Town” and he uses it as a description of Hell itself. It is the initial setting of the book, the landing pad for the story’s nameless protagonist. The book picks up following the protagonist as he arrives without explanation in the Grey Town, much like how Cobb and Mal wash up onto the shores of Limbo. The protagonist peers around him and sees only dilapidated shops, deserted homes, and one peculiar bus stop. It is evening, but far enough into dusk that the sun has fallen below the horizon. The only gathering of people that he can see is idling in line at the bus stop, so our protagonist instinctively gets in line and waits. He notices that, one after one, the line shortens as people leave. Soon only a few remain in line. The patience of our protagonist is rewarded as the bus arrives, and he hops on. At once the magical vehicle soars into flight, flying high above the town. It is then that our protagonist turns to a fellow passenger and inquires about the emptiness of the place,

"It seems the deuce of a town," I volunteered, "and that's what I can't understand. The parts of it that I saw were so empty. Was there once a much larger population?" "Not at all," said my neighbour. "The trouble is that they're so quarrelsome. As soon as anyone arrives he settles in some street. Before he's been there twenty-four hours he quarrels with his neighbour. Before the week is over he's quarrelled so badly that he decides to move. Very like he finds the next street empty because all the people there have quarrelled with their neighbours-and moved. So he settles in. If by any chance the street is full, he goes further. But even if he stays, it makes no odds. He's sure to have another quarrel pretty soon and then he'll move on again. Finally he'll move right out to the edge of the town and build a new house. You see, it's easy here. You've only got to think a house and there it is. That's how the town keeps on growing." "Leaving more and more empty streets?" "That's right. And time's sort of odd here. That place where we caught the bus is thousands of miles from the Civic Centre where all the newcomers arrive from earth. All the people you've met were living near the bus stop: but they'd taken centuries-of our time-to get there, by gradual removals." "And what about the earlier arrivals? I mean -there must be people who came from earth to your town even longer ago." "That's right. There are. They've been moving on and on. Getting further apart. They're so far off by now that they could never think of coming to the bus stop at all. Astronomical distances. There's a bit of rising ground near where I live and a chap has a telescope. You can see the lights of the inhabited houses, where those old ones live, millions of miles away. Millions of miles from us and from one another. Every now and then they move further still. That's one of the disappointments. I thought you'd meet interesting historical characters. But you don't: they're too far away."

The Grey Town is infinite because its wanderers never settle down. They are perpetually discontent, driven mad by dissatisfaction, forced to double down on their misery. Their stubborn quarrelsomeness keeps them apart, always searching for a better place. There is nothing preventing them from returning to the bus stop (which we later find to be a step towards salvation), except for their insistence to make a utopia for themselves. In describing the town as such, Lewis posits his theology of Hell. 

Hell, in Lewis’ eyes, is the infinite expansion of human desire. It is what happens when God lets us have our own way. It is us “spinning our wheels” for eternity. As humans, we were made for our Creator. We were made to drink from the well-spring of fellowship with God (Isaiah 55:1-3). He is the one who satisfies our restless desires and brings peace to the frenzy of our ever-shifting hearts. Without the security of his gentle love, we are nomads, tossed about by the waves (James 1:6). We embrace a state of Limbo.

So as Cobb reflects on his time building Limbo, he becomes increasingly convicted of his need to sever[1] his attachment to Mal. There is no joy in his heart or spring to his step as he passes by building after building, all in disarray. The vanity of his dreams unfolds before him, and he sees the shadows for what they are. His eyes are adjusting, straining in the sunlight. As he surveys the ruins of his former life, he commits to dethrone Mal, the idol of his heart.
